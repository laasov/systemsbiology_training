## TASK 2. Boolean network simulation.

### Item a

See boolsim.R

### Item b

```{r}
source("~/Documents/intro_to_systems_biology/Exercise Set 2-20210505/boolsim.R")

#
#   Synchronous and deterministic Boolean network simulation
#
#   Eats a 5-dimensional logical vector
#   Updates the model according to given Boolean functions
#   Returns the state vector at t = steps
#

# p53 = 1, MDM2 = 1, BCL2 = 1, BAX = 1, CASP = 1
model.state <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 1)

# Without perturbation on MDM2 state
boolsim(steps = 10, model.state, F)
```

### Item c

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system reaches an attractor instantaneously on third iteration.
  \item The attractor is cyclic.
  \item Since Boolean networks are deterministic, there is no escaping from the attractor. The model is thus fully predictable for all $t > 10$ without running the model longer.
\end{enumerate}

### Item d

```{r}
# With perturbed MDM2 state --- forces MDM2 = 0 at all times
boolsim(steps = 10, model.state, perturb = T)
```
